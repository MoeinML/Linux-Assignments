# Assignment 8: Server Firewall Configuration

## Introduction
A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted networks (like the internet). 

The goal of this exercise is to protect our server by:
* Allowing only necessary services (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
* Blocking unauthorized access.
* Preventing common network attacks like SYN flooding.
